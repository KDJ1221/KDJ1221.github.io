			My name is <strong>Kimmiko James</strong>, and I’m an aspiring software engineer. I strive to become a <strong>designer, creator, and an innovator</strong> in order to make an impact whenever possible. 
			</p>

			<p>
			I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Davis with the intention of becoming a Computer Science and Engineering major by the start of my Junior year. During Spring Quarter of my Freshman year I was a <strong>research assistant</strong> for the VICTR(Virtual Interaction and Communication Technology Research) Lab in which I <strong>worked with virtual reality</strong> to measure how UC Davis students perceived students of Hispanic descent within virtual environments. Now, I am currently <strong>creating a game for the VICTR lab</strong> in which gun violence perspectives will be analyzed, as this is an important issue within today's society.

			Over the course of a few months and with the help of online resources such as Udemy, I self-taught myself how to program with <strong>C#, C++, and Java languages</strong>. I tend to work on smaller projects for fun, such as personal video games created with Unity/Unreal game engines, but am eager to work towards bigger projects in the future that will involve Virtual Reality technology and app development.
